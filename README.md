# Thinking of you

## Description
Small script that randomly selects and track people to write notes of gratitude. Inspired by John
Robert's graduation speech in which he encouraged the audience to take advantage of little ways to make people 
feel special.

## Motivation
Make people feel special- write people notes
> The last bit of advice I’ll give you is very simple, but I think it could make a big difference in your life. 
>Once a week, you should write a note to someone. Not an email. A note on a piece of paper. 
>It will take you exactly 10 minutes. Talk to an adult, let them tell you what a stamp is. 
>You can put the stamp on the envelope. Again, 10 minutes, once a week. I will help you, right now. 
>I will dictate to you the first note you should write. It will say, 
>‘Dear [fill in the name of a teacher at Cardigan Mountain School].’ Say: ‘I have started at this new school. 
>We are reading [blank] in English. Football or soccer practice is hard, but I’m enjoying it. Thank you for teaching me.’ 
>Put it in an envelope, put a stamp on it and send it. It will mean a great deal to people who — for reasons 
>most of us cannot contemplate — have dedicated themselves to teaching middle school boys. As I said, that will take 
>you exactly 10 minutes a week. By the end of the school year, you will have sent notes to 40 people. Forty people 
>will feel a little more special because you did, and they will think you are very special because of what you did. 
>No one else is going to carry that dividend during your time at school.
